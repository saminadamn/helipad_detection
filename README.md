# 🚁 Helipad Image Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a **deep learning solution for automatic helipad detection in aerial/satellite imagery** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system can classify images as containing helipads or not, which has applications in aviation, emergency services, urban planning, and autonomous vehicle navigation.

## Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Manually identifying helipads in aerial imagery is time-consuming and prone to human error. There was a need for an automated system that could:

- Accurately detect helipads in various lighting conditions
- Handle different helipad designs and orientations
- Distinguish helipads from similar circular structures
- Process images quickly for real-time applications


**Solution**: Developed a CNN-based binary classifier that achieves high accuracy in helipad detection through:

- Real dataset training with data augmentation
- Robust model architecture designed for aerial imagery
- Comprehensive evaluation and testing framework

## 🧠 Model Architecture & Design Decisions

### Model Selection: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

**Why CNN was chosen:**

1. **Spatial Feature Recognition**: CNNs excel at detecting spatial patterns and features in images
2. **Translation Invariance**: Helipads can appear anywhere in an image
3. **Hierarchical Learning**: CNNs learn from simple edges to complex helipad patterns
4. **Proven Performance**: CNNs are the gold standard for image classification tasks


### Final Model Architecture

```python
# Model: Simple Helipad Classifier
Input Layer: (224, 224, 3) - RGB images
├── Conv2D(32, 3x3) + ReLU
├── MaxPooling2D(2x2)
├── Dropout(0.25)
├── Conv2D(64, 3x3) + ReLU
├── MaxPooling2D(2x2)
├── Dropout(0.25)
├── Conv2D(128, 3x3) + ReLU
├── MaxPooling2D(2x2)
├── Dropout(0.25)
├── Flatten()
├── Dense(512) + ReLU
├── Dropout(0.5)
└── Dense(2) + Softmax  # Binary classification
```

**Architecture Rationale:**

- **Progressive Feature Extraction**: 32→64→128 filters capture increasingly complex features
- **Regularization**: Dropout layers prevent overfitting
- **Appropriate Depth**: 3 convolutional blocks balance complexity and training stability
- **Global Feature Integration**: Dense layers combine spatial features for final classification


## 🔄 Training Process & Data Pipeline

### 1. Data Collection & Preparation

```python
# Data Sources:
- Real helipad images: 200+ actual helipad photographs
- Augmented dataset: 300 variations through transformations
- Negative samples: 300 synthetic non-helipad images
- Total training data: 600+ images
```

### 2. Data Augmentation Strategy

```python
def apply_augmentations(image):
    """Applied transformations for robust training"""
    - Horizontal/Vertical flipping
    - Random rotation (-45° to +45°)
    - Brightness adjustment (0.7x to 1.3x)
    - Contrast modification (0.8x to 1.2x)
    - Gaussian noise injection
    - Random cropping and resizing
```

**Why these augmentations:**

- **Rotation**: Helipads can be viewed from any angle
- **Brightness/Contrast**: Different lighting and weather conditions
- **Flipping**: No inherent orientation in helipad detection
- **Noise**: Simulates real-world image quality variations


### 3. Training Configuration

```python
# Training Parameters:
EPOCHS = 20
BATCH_SIZE = 16
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001 (Adam optimizer)
VALIDATION_SPLIT = 0.2
TEST_SPLIT = 0.2
```

**Parameter Justification:**

- **Small batch size**: Stable training with limited data
- **Conservative learning rate**: Prevents overshooting optimal weights
- **Moderate epochs**: Balances training time and convergence
